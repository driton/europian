# European Alphabet Converter

This project is a web-based text conversion tool that enables users to convert text written in the Albanian language into the proposed European Alphabet. It supports transformations of digraphs and diacritics to their equivalents in the European Alphabet and allows users to experiment with text conversion for research and educational purposes.
