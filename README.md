# European Alphabet Project

The European Alphabet is a proposed writing system designed to complement existing alphabets by providing a unified framework for transliteration and multilingual expression. This project aims to serve as a bridge between languages, enabling clearer communication, linguistic research, and cultural exchange.

## Purpose

The European Alphabet is not intended to replace current alphabets but to act as an additional tool for transliteration and enhanced multilingual understanding. Its primary goals include:

- Simplifying transliteration across languages.
- Providing a standardized system for expressing sounds unique to specific languages.
- Supporting linguistic diversity while fostering unity through a common supplementary alphabet.

The alphabet incorporates symbols inspired by existing scripts (e.g., Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek) and introduces unique diacritics and characters to represent sounds that are often difficult to transliterate.

## Features

### 1. **Support for Multilingual Transcription**
The European Alphabet allows seamless conversion from languages such as Albanian, English, French, Japanese, Croatian, and Arabic. It provides unique representations for complex phonemes and digraphs.

### 2. **Special Characters and Transformations**
The alphabet includes specialized transformations, such as:

- **Digraphs:**
  - `Rr`, `RR`, `rr`, `rR` → `Я`
  - `Sh`, `sh`, `SH`, `sH` → `Ƨ`
  - `Th`, `th`, `TH`, `tH` → `З`

- **Diacritics for Vowels:**
  - `A` → `Á` (Á)
  - `E` → `Ē` (Ē)
  - `Ë` → `Ë̈`
  - `U` → `Ŭ` (Ŭ)
  - `Y` → `Ŷ` (Y̌)

- **Other Symbols:**
  - Flipped `C` (ↄ) for `Ç`, `CH`, or similar sounds.

### 3. **Adaptability**
This system is adaptable to various scripts and languages. Examples include:

- **Japanese:**
  - Hiragana `し` (shi) → `Ƨ`
  - Katakana `チ` (chi) → `Č`

- **Arabic:**
  - `خ` (kh) → `X`
  - `ث` (th) → `З`

- **Croatian:**
  - `Č` → `Č`
  - `Đ` → `Ð`

**Input:** こんにちは (Konnichiwa)  
**Output:** KoƧƧiƧa

### Arabic to European Alphabet
**Input:** السلام عليكم (As-salamu alaykum)  
**Output:** Al-salamu alaykum

### English to European Alphabet
**Input:** Thoughtful thinkers think thoroughly.  
**Output:** Зoughtful Зinkers Зink Зoroughly.

## How It Works

1. **Input Text:** Type or paste text in the source language.
2. **Processing Rules:** The tool applies predefined mappings and rules to convert characters to their European Alphabet equivalents.
3. **Output Text:** The transformed text is displayed in real-time or exported as needed.
